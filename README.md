# Analysis
Both of the waveforms show the same functionality, because they are both a design of the same circuit, just using two different methods. 
The structural creates each component to show where the output is coming from and the behavioral is doing the same thing, just not defining each component.

A decoder is used to create combinations of inputs and then set a single term to the output. It is a collection of various logic gates and this is helpful in a computer memory because that is a collection of logic gates.
